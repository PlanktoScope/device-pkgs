# If you want to add more host entries and you want your changes to persist across reboots,
# create and edit a new file at /etc/planktoscope/hosts.
# In that file, the string "{machine-name}" will be automatically replaced with the machine-specific
# name, which will look something like "metal-slope-23501".
# To apply your changes immediately without rebooting, restart the
# planktoscope-org.update-hosts-machine-name system service
# and then restart the dnsmasq system service.
