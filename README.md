Software package repositories for the PlanktoScope software distro

## Introduction

Pallets are simple platforms, usually wooden, which enable moving stacks of packages safely and easily:

This repository provides a collection of software packages in *Pallets*, a software packaging system for enabling safe, simple, and easy software installations and upgrades on PlanktoScopes. Technical information about Pallets is available in [`reference.md`](reference.md).

This Github repository is a collection of four Pallet repositories of software packages for Planktoscopes - `core`, `community`, `restricted`, `testing` - which serve different purposes and have different types of software packages. Each Pallet repository has a `README.md` file which describes its purpose. Packages in the `core`, `community`, and `restricted` repositories are configured to be deployed as integrated components of the overall PlanktoScope software distro.
