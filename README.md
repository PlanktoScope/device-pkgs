Forklift packages for the PlanktoScope software distro

## Introduction

This repository provides a collection of [*Forklift*](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift)
software packages for the PlanktoScope's software distro. Specifically, this repository consists of
four categories of software packages for Planktoscopes - `core`, `community`, `restricted`,
`testing` - which serve different purposes and have different types of software packages. Each
category of packages has its own subdirectory with a `README.md` file which describes its purpose.
Packages in this repository are configured to be deployed as integrated components of the overall
PlanktoScope software distro.

## Usage
