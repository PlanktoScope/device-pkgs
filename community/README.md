Community-maintained open-source PlanktoScope packages

This repository contains packages which are maintained by users from the community working with the
PlanktoScope core team and which are available under
[OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/) open-source licenses. These packages are supported
by contributions from users, and they could end if their maintainers stop supporting them. They may
also be removed in a future release due to lack of support by upstream maintainers.
